Hello world! I'm a second year PhD student in statistics at Stanford University, advised by [Emmanuel Cand&#232;s](https://candes.su.domains), and supported by the [John and Fannie Hertz Foundation](https://www.hertzfoundation.org). While I'm not working on the theory of distribution-free uncertainty quantification, I apply these methods as a consultant to The Washington Post elections team. 

Before starting my PhD, I spent 3 years at [D.E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com) where I worked on fitting polarizable force fields for all-atom simulations. I joined DESRES after earning my B.S. (with distinction) in Mathematical and Computational Science and M.S. in Statistics from Stanford University in 2017.
