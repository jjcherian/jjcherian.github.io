I’m a fourth year PhD student in statistics at Stanford University, where I’m grateful to be advised by [Emmanuel Candès](https://candes.su.domains) and supported by the [John and Fannie Hertz Foundation](https://www.hertzfoundation.org). While I’m not working on the theory of distribution-free uncertainty quantification, I apply these methods as a consultant to The Washington Post elections team.
Before starting my PhD, I spent 3 years at [D.E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com) (“DESRES”) where I worked on improving polarizable force fields for all-atom simulations. I joined DESRES after earning my B.S. in Mathematical and Computational Science and M.S. in Statistics from Stanford University in 2017.
