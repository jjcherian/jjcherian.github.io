I’m a fifth year PhD student in statistics at Stanford University, where I’m grateful to be advised by [Emmanuel Candès](https://candes.su.domains) and supported by the [John and Fannie Hertz Foundation](https://www.hertzfoundation.org). My research aims to tackle fundamental questions about the reliability and fairness of black-box models. For example, does a model treat different groups equitably, or can we quantify model uncertainty before taking action on each prediction? My approach belongs to the nascent field of _model-free inference_, which makes minimal assumptions on the data and model being used. While I’m not working on new methods for model-free inference, I apply these ideas to election forecasting as a consultant to The Washington Post.

Before starting my PhD, I spent 3 years at [D.E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com) (“DESRES”) where I worked on improving polarizable force fields for all-atom simulations. I joined DESRES after earning my B.S. in Mathematical and Computational Science and M.S. in Statistics from Stanford University in 2017.
